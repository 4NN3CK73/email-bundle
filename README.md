Azine Email Bundle
==================

Symfony2 Bundle provides the following functionalities:

- simplify the rendering and sending of nicely styled html-emails from within your application
- provide an infrastructure to send notifications/update-infos to your recipients, immediately or aggregated and scheduled.
- provide an infrastructure to send newsletters to the recipients which wish to recieve it.

## Requirements

##### 1. Swift-Mailer with working configuration 
Mails are sent using the Swiftmailer with it's configuration.

So the symfony/swiftmailer-bundle must be installed and properly configured.

https://github.com/symfony/SwiftmailerBundle

##### 2. Doctrine for notification spooling
For spooling notifications, Notification-Objects (AzineEmailBundle/ are stored in the database. So far only doctrine-storage is implemented.

##### 3. FOSUserBundle
In its current Version it depends on the FOSUserBundle, as it also "beautyfies" the mails send from the 
FOSUserBundle and uses the Users to provide recipient information for the mails to be sent.

=> Azine\EmailBundle\Entity\Notification



## Installation
To install AzineGeoBlockingBundle with Composer just add the following to your composer.json file:

```
// composer.json
{
    // ...
    require: {
        // ...
        "azine/email-bundle": "dev-master"
    }
}
```

Then, you can install the new dependencies by running Composerâ€™s update command from the directory where your composer.json file is located:

```
php composer.phar update
```

Now, Composer will automatically download all required files, and install them for you. 
All that is left to do is to update your AppKernel.php file, and register the new bundle:


```
<?php

// in AppKernel::registerBundles()
$bundles = array(
    // ...
   	new Azine\EmailBundle\EmailBundle(),
    // ...
);
```


## Configuration options
For the bundle to work with the default-settings, no config-options are required, but the swiftmailer must be configured.

This is the complete list of configuration options with their defaults.
```
// app/config/config.yml
azine_email:

    # the class of your implementation of the RecipientInterface
    recipient_class:      Acme\SomeBundle\Entity\User # Required

    # the fieldname of the boolean field on the recipient class indicating, that a newsletter should be sent or not
    recipient_newsletter_field:  news_letter

    # the service-id of your implementation of the nofitier service to be used
    notifier_service:     azine_email.example.notifier_service

    # the service-id of your implementation of the template provider service to be used
    template_provider:    azine_email.example.template_provider # Required

    # the service-id of the implementation of the RecipientProviderInterface to be used
    recipient_provider:   azine_email.default.recipient_provider

    # the service-id of the mailer service to be used
    template_twig_swift_mailer:  azine_email.default.template_twig_swift_mailer
    no_reply:

        # the no-reply email-address
        email:                no-reply@example.com # Required

        # the name to appear with the 'no-reply'-address.
        name:                 notification daemon # Required

    # absolute path to the image-folder containing the images used in your templates.
    image_dir:            %kernel.root_dir%/../vendor/azine/email-bundle/Azine/EmailBundle/Resources/htmlTemplateImages/

```

## Customise the content and layout of your emails
You can/must customize the layout of your email in three ways:
- define your own styles by writing your own implementation of the TemplateProviderInterface 
- use your own images
- create your own html and txt twig-templates.

A general overview is given here and the classes you should extend contain more inline-documentation on how stuff works.

### TemplateProvider
This bundle includes a default implementation of a TemplateProvider ( => AzineTemplateProvider) 
and also an example how to customize things (ExampleTemplateProvider).

Remember that css-styles don't work in most email viewers. You need to embed everything into the attributes (e.g. "style") of 
your html-elements and do not use div-elements as they are not properly displayed in many viewers. 
Use Tables instead (<table><tr><td> etc.) to layout your emails.

e.g. <table width="100%"><tr><td height="20" style="font-size: 12px; color: blue;">Bla bla</td></tr></table>

You can define styles you would like to use in your emails and and also blocks of html-code. 
E.g. a drop-shadow implemented with td-elements with different shades of grey as background color. 
=> see "leftShadow" and "cellSeparator" in AzineTemplateProvider  


### Images
You can use your own images which will be embeded into the emails. To do this, just define the path to your image-folder in your config.yml. => see above

### Twig-Templates
There are two kinds of templates required, both for html- and txt-content.

#### 1. the wrapper-templates: 
These templates contain a header-section (logo etc.), header-content-section ("This is our newsletter blablabla"), main content (see "content-item-templates") and footer (links etc.).

They contain stuff that is usually exactly the same (except the greeting) for each of your recipients of this email. 

The supplied baseEmailLayout-template in this bundle is split into two files "baseEmailLayout.txt.twig" and "baseEmailLayout.html.twig" to make them more easy to extend and manage. 

The "*.txt.twig" is the template that will be called for rendering. It must contain the following blocks:

- subject
- body_txt
- body_html

As mentioned, the supplied "baseEmailLayout" is split into two files. The *.txt.twig with the required blocks and the *.html.twig which is included in the body_html-block of the *.txt.twig template.

In both templates you have access to the styles and snippets you defined in the TemplateProvider you use.

#### 2. the content item-templates: 
In a newsletter- or notification-email you probably have different kind of items you would like to include. 

For example in one email to your users you could mention 6 private messages, 3 events and 2 news-articles. 

For those three types you can define different "content-item-templates" and styles that should be available for these templates.

An example for "Private-Messages" is included => 'Resources/views/contentItem/message.txt.twig' and 'Resources/views/contentItem/message.html.twig'.

For a type of content-item you must allways provide a html and a txt-version. They will be referenced by their full ID withour the format.twig-ending.

=> AzineEmailBundle:contentItem:message for 'Resources/views/contentItem/message.txt.twig' and 'Resources/views/contentItem/message.html.twig'

Inside those templates you have access to the styles and snippets defined in your TemplateProvider.


## TWIG-Filter textWrap
This bundle also adds a twig filter that allows you to wrap text using the php function wordwrap. It defaults to a line width of 75 chars.

...
{{ "This text should be wrapped after 75 characters, as it is too long for just one line. But there is not line break in the text so far" | textWrap }}
or
{{ "This text should be wrapped after 30 characters, as it is too long for just one line. But there is not line break in the text so far" | textWrap(30) }}
...


## Open Issues
- I'd like to remove the dependency to the FOSUserBundle, but as I work with the FOSUserBundle, this has no priority for me. If you would like to see this implemented, let me know.
